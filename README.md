# Overview

This was supposed to be a demo where a searched IMDB using an API from theimdbapi.org.  But, on the day where I was going to put this demo together that API was down.  Whenever I sent out a request I would get a 523, origin unreachable, response code. So I switched to the Star Wars API to do a similar demo.

# How Did I Build It?

For this demo, I used the following technologies:

- React
- Redux
- Redux Sagas
- Axios
- React Bootstrap Table

The project was bundled using webpack and babel.
